# Sonnet number 1 #

by _Rosie Freear_.


Come fight, come play, in the greatest of wars!
    Display honour for your country and crown.
Have far more virtue than ever before,
    Let's salute Britain and take these Huns down.
Our land's in pieces; she's bruised and broken,
    And needs you to give a hand in this game.
She'll pour out her bottled up emotions,
    Don't let her efforts be poisoned in vain.
Praises for soldiers: of England's young men,
    Raining in torrents from heavens above.
we cannot endure a long war again.
    Straining against its leash of wind: a dove.
Do you want England's blood on your conscience?
    If so, defeat will be your comeuppance.
